    <h2>VALORANT</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Valorant is a free&ndash;to&ndash;play first&ndash;person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.
      Teased under the codename <i>Project A</i> in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020,
      followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. <em>Valorant</em> takes inspiration form the
      <em>Counter&ndash;Strike</em> series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menum spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.
